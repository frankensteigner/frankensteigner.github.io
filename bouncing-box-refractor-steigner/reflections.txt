1. How is the jQuery file being loaded into this project: direct download or Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
        The jQuery file is being loaded into this project via a CDN. Since jQuery is such a large file, it is more effective to
        access it through a CDN than to download all of it directly to one's computer. 

2. If you load the index.js file before the jquery file our program doesnâ€™t work. Why? 
   Open the preview in a new tab and look at the console to help you find out why.
        Parts of the code in index.js- e.g., the click function- need to access jQuery in order to run. If
        they are not accessed, the index.js file will not be able to run that code. 

3. In your opinion, what are the pros of refactoring your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into separate files? What are the cons?
        Refactoring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into seperate files makes it easier to differentiate the parts of the code 
        that handle different things. When one needs to edit the text of a webpage, for example, instead of sifting through
        all their extra code to get to the html, they can simply access the file with all of it. However, there can be 
        issues with importing the files into each other, and making sure everything runs  
        smoothly across the code. 

4. In your opinion, what are the pros of refactoring your JavaScript code into separate functions? What are the cons?
        Refactoring JavaScript into seperate functions allows for code to be more organised into seperate parts. 
        It also means parts of a function canbe reused in other functions that perform the same action without rewriting the code. 
        It can, however, in some cases make code more complicated; not all functions need to be refactored. Some are
        simple and self contained enough already.
